## Solutions For Homework2

I've uploaded two parts to the github: our traditional method to play game with good grades and a failed trial by using neutral network.

The traditional method is mainly written by Bo Yue and the method of neutral network is mainly written by Chi Zhang.

We hope that if you can find our github, you can get inspiration from our failure and successfully use machine learning to solve the chess-playing problem
